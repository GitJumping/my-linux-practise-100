# man

```shell
[noah@localhost ~]$ man ls
```

按q键退出



`man`也是命令，有9章，可以用man查看man的帮助

```shell
[noah@localhost ~]$ man 7 man
```



`ls`只有1章，可以用 `man 1 ls`

```shell
[noah@localhost ~]$ man 1 ls
```

而看第一章的时候，可以省略1，就变成 `man ls`

```shell
[noah@localhost ~]$ man ls
```



加章节，是为了区分，不同章节下的命令或者配置文件可能重名

比如 `passwd`

```shell
[noah@localhost ~]$ man 1 passwd
```

```shell
[noah@localhost ~]$ man 5 passwd
```



如果不知道是命令，还是配置，可以用`-a`参数

回车，Ctrl-D，Ctrl-C

```shell
[noah@localhost ~]$ man -a passwd
--Man-- next: sslpasswd(1ssl) [ view (return) | skip (Ctrl-D) | quit (Ctrl-C) ]
```



# help

## 命令解释器（内部命令）

```shell
[noah@localhost ~]$ help cd
cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]]] [dir]
    Change the shell working directory.

    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable.

    The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing
    DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).
    A null directory name is the same as the current directory.  If DIR begins
    with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.

    If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set,
    the word is assumed to be  a variable name.  If that variable has a value,
    its value is used for DIR.

    Options:
        -L	force symbolic links to be followed
        -P	use the physical directory structure without following symbolic
    	links
        -e	if the -P option is supplied, and the current working directory
    	cannot be determined successfully, exit with a non-zero status

    The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified.

    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 if the directory is changed, and if $PWD is set successfully when
    -P is used; non-zero otherwise.
```

## 区分内外命令

```shell
[noah@localhost ~]$ type cd
cd is a shell builtin
[noah@localhost ~]$ type ls
ls is aliased to `ls --color=auto'
```

# info帮助

## 作为help的补充，全英文

```shell
[noah@localhost ~]$ info ls
```
